        do {
            audioPlayer = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: soundURL!)

}

// "do,try,catch" is used when there is a possibility of throw an error, so it "try" to do something and if there is a erros we can deal with it.

// Another option to use those is:
// "try! audioPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: soundURL!)"
// In this case we are 100% sure that we wouldn't have any error, then we do need to catch it.
